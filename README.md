# AI-problems
These are my course works for CSC480 Aritifical Intelligence.
It contains three given projects and one final project which topic 
was chose by student.

## HW1
Using graph search algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle problem.
Methos used: DFS, BFS, best-first, iterative deepening and three A star
algorithms with different heuristic functions

## HW2
Using Minimax algorithm to create a AI oppont in game. 
**You can't win**

## HW4
Have no idea how to name you baby? Check out my random-baby-name-generator with the power of Markov Chain!

## Final project
This is my attempt to solve Rubik Qube in  minimal steps with graph search
